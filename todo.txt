track most recently used param names
    - if any param name field is edited, update mostRecentParamNames in store
    - whenever a new GenerationTask is constructed is takes its default param names from mostRecentParamNames

implement queue processing behavior
    - store running items separately
    - running item visuals:
        - green pulse
        - gear anim icon
        - last line of status
    - running state for GenerationEditor
        - darkened overlay to disable ui; backgrop blur
        - "Generating:" + prompt text + "click to see terminal output"
            - clicking that button expands status area to show terminal output
implement status bar
    - show general app status: whether anything is running, number of completed generations, items in queue 
    - show console output + expand/collapse
implement "completed generations"
implement Gallery

finish up Generation Editor
    - [maybe] add img path export / file-writing
    - [maybe] sync canvas width/height to w/h args
