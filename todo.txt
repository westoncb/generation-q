implement Gallery
    - need to virtualize grid, can't just load everything
    - [maybe] back with sqlite db

finish up Generation Editor
    - fix layout issue: if tab-panel needs to scroll, running overlay shows in weird position
    - add img path export / file-writing
    - sync drawing canvas width/height to w/h args (its current layout should be adopted by a scrolling container so the canvas can be arbitrary sizes within it without breaking the layout)

track most recently used param names
    - if any param name field is edited, update mostRecentParamNames in store
    - whenever a new GenerationTask is constructed is takes its default param names from mostRecentParamNames
    - do this for `command` and init image export directory too
        - or find another way to store/recall previously used commands/export locations

add actions to preload.js (context bridge)
    - exportInitImage(path, data) => succeed/fail
    - scanForNewImages(outputDirectories) => string[] (new image paths)

implement status bar
    - show general app status: whether anything is running, number of completed generations, items in queue 
    - have indicator for any errors that occurred during task-run; click to expand and show full error elements

[maybe] add events for generations start/finished
    - then you can e.g. switch to next gTask when previous finishes, IF Generation Editor was the active tab when it finished (i.e. they were watching it run)
