track most recently used param names
    - if any param name field is edited, update mostRecentParamNames in store
    - whenever a new GenerationTask is constructed is takes its default param names from mostRecentParamNames

add events for generations start/finished
    - then you can e.g. switch to next gTask when previous finishes, IF Generation Editor was the active tab when it finished (i.e. they were watching it run)

implement queue processing behavior
    - fix layout issue: if tab-panel needs to scroll, running overlay shows in weird position
implement status bar
    - show general app status: whether anything is running, number of completed generations, items in queue 
    - have indicator for any errors that occurred during task-run; click to expand and show full error elements
implement "completed generations"

implement Gallery

finish up Generation Editor
    - [maybe] add img path export / file-writing
    - [maybe] sync canvas width/height to w/h args
